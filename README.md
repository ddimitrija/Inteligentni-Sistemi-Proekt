2. Наслов на проектот : Music Taste Discovery Agent (Spotify)

3. Тип на проект : Clustering & Machine Learning

4. Опис на проектот : This project creates an intelligent music recommendation agent that analyzes Spotify songs using clustering and machine learning. It groups songs based on audio features like tempo, energy, and danceability to detect listening patterns. The agent is designed for Spotify users who want personalized music suggestions tailored to their tastes. Based on the identified clusters, it recommends new songs similar to the user's preferences while allowing some exploration of new styles. This system demonstrates how machine learning can uncover patterns in music and support intelligent, adaptive recommendations.

5. AI API(и) (ако е применливо) : This project uses Spotify Web API to access real music data and audio features. This allows the agent to analyze songs and make intelligent, personalized recommendations.

6. Датасет (ако е применливо) : No datasets are used since Spotify Web API provides everything needed.

7. Карактеристики на проектот : Analyze music features, cluster songs or users, recommend songs.
